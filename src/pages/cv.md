### General skills, no-buzzwords

I feel confident about:

- HTML5, CSS3 and ES6 from the ground up.

  > I power up my daily job leveraging modern tooling from NodeJS.
  > From edgy Javascript bundlers to legacy task runners.

- PHP, Ruby and Groovy without doubt.

  > It rhymes, you know. All good songs are enough good if they make you shake your booty!

I've been there:

- Docker, AWS, Heroku, Linode and/or DigitalOcean for web services.

  > Required to be online, I can setup things on free SaaS and paid solutions.

- Bitbucket, Gitlab, GitHub for VCS

  > Feel free to delete everything on your side, I'll never do the same. I do the backup!

- TravisCI and Jenkins for CI/CD

  > Of course I'm not lazy, I just prefer for CI to finish my job.

### What I've been doing?

<p class="highlight">
  I started working remotely, doing low-income tasks.
  Then I joined to a small digital-marketing to learn RoR while doing HTML+CSS+JS right before the ReactJS era.

## 2016-present

- Full-stack developer &hearts; AgaveLab <br> Jan. 2018 (&hellip;)

- Freelance full-stack web developer <br> Feb. 2017 &mdash; Dec. 2017 (GDL)

  > Once again, it was time to start from scratch. Also I started another OSS project: [MIDI-on-SCOOPS](//github.com/dubnix/midi-on-scoops).

- Full-time / full-stack web developer &hearts; Empathia <br> Mar. 2016 &mdash; Jan. 2017 (GDL)

  > I really wanted to build good things and help people, so I moved to GDL in order to start doing that.
  > Here I wrote small abstractions just to help out on the job, or even just for fun.

## 2009-2016

- Full-time / full-stack web developer &hearts; Grupo Expansión <br> Jun. 2013 &mdash; Feb. 2016 (CDMX)

  > My career was boosted up on GEx, motivated by a great team with strong opinions, solid commands and the best mentoring.
  > Here I started to create tooling and my first OSS project: [json-schema-faker](http://json-schema-faker.js.org/).

- Full-time web developer &hearts; Out of The Box<sup>1</sup> <br> Feb. 2011 &mdash; May. 2013 (CDMX)

  > Here I started to learn very serious stuff on web-development, here I did CoffeeScript, Ruby on Rails and Git.
  > Loved HAML, Sass and other hot stuff from these years. I was using tooling for first time!

- Freelance web developer <br> Aug. 2009 &mdash; Jan. 2011 (CDMX)

  > I used to build scripts for picture-windows on mIRC, learned bit of GameMaker and did some CLI stuff with TurboPascal.
  > After learning bits of web-development for the backend with ASP/PHP I started to search for something.

### Education &mdash; really

<p class="highlight">
  I started at home, learning mainly PHP and HTML+CSS+JS stuff right before the jQuery era.
  Google and Firefox were very young at the time.
</p>

## 2000-2009

- Self-teach at home <br> 1999-2000 &mdash; Jul. 2009 (CDMX)

  > During this period, I dropped the school and also tried several times to grade after years.
  > Fortunately, good people<sup>1</sup> found me useful and hired me without requiring any of it.
