### General purpose skills, no-buzzwords

I feel confident about:

- HTML5, CSS3 and ES6 from the ground up.

  > I power up my daily job leveraging modern NodeJS tooling
  > &mdash; from edgy Javascript bundlers to legacy task runners.

- PHP, Ruby and Groovy without doubt.

  > It rhymes, you know. All good songs are enough good if they make you shake your booty!

- CLI oriented, Bash for the hard-work, Fish for productivity.

  > I use the terminal a lot, if I can do anything faster on the terminal I'll do
  > &mdash; i.e. for managing my SSH connections I just built [SSHi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sshi).

I've been there:

- Docker, AWS, Heroku, Linode and/or DigitalOcean for web services.

  > Required to be online, I can setup things on free SaaS and paid solutions.

- MongoDB, PostgreSQL and SQLite are my favourite databases.

  > I have managed and built services and platforms using one or many of them at once.

- Bitbucket, Gitlab, GitHub for VCS

  > Feel free to delete everything on your side, I'll never do the same. I do the backup!

- TravisCI, CircleCI or Jenkins for CI/CD

  > Of course I'm not lazy, I just prefer for CI to finish my job. Btw, I use GitHub actions as well.

### What I'm looking for?

- I want to be challenged

  > I really like the challenge I can handle, due i'm not an expert, rockstar, ninja, 10x or whatever
  > &mdash; but anything well-defined will convince me and anyone else if you ask me.

- I want to be productive

  > I like to craft web stuff carefully, not guided by the trend but constructed through architectural choices
  > &mdash; also I'll try to not waste our time and money as modern non-sense.

- I want to be efficient

  > I'll never use a backend stack to just render a landing page and few forms, or vice versa,
  > I would avoid to build a complex application entirely on the frontend &mdash; and I hope you get into the topic...

### What I've been doing?

- Full-stack developer &hearts; AgaveLab <br> Jan. 2018 (&hellip;)

  > I manage myself as generalist, from bash scripts to E2E features on web applications of any kind.
  > My actual stack is entirely based on NodeJS but I can switch to whatever is needed.

- Freelance full-stack web developer <br> Feb. 2017 &mdash; Dec. 2017 (GDL)

  > Once again, it was time to start from scratch. Also I started another OSS project: [MIDI-on-SCOOPS](//github.com/dubnix/midi-on-scoops).

- Full-time / full-stack web developer &hearts; Empathia <br> Mar. 2016 &mdash; Jan. 2017 (GDL)

  > I really wanted to build good things and help people, so I moved to GDL in order to start doing that.
  > Here I wrote small abstractions just to help out on the job, or even just for fun.

- Full-time / full-stack web developer &hearts; Grupo Expansión <br> Jun. 2013 &mdash; Feb. 2016 (CDMX)

  > My career was boosted up on GEx, motivated by a great team with strong opinions, solid commands and the best mentoring.
  > Here I started to create tooling and my first OSS project: [json-schema-faker](http://json-schema-faker.js.org/).

- Full-time web developer &hearts; Out of The Box<sup>1</sup> <br> Feb. 2011 &mdash; May. 2013 (CDMX)

  > Here I started to learn very serious stuff on web-development, here I did CoffeeScript, Ruby on Rails and Git.
  > Loved HAML, Sass and other hot stuff from these years. I was using tooling for first time!

- Freelance web developer <br> Aug. 2009 &mdash; Jan. 2011 (CDMX)
  
  > I used to build scripts for picture-windows on mIRC, learned bit of GameMaker and did some CLI stuff with TurboPascal.
  > After learning bits of web-development for the backend with ASP/PHP I started to search for something.

### Education &mdash; really

- Self-taught at home <br> 1999-2000 &mdash; Jul. 2009 (CDMX)
  
  > During this period, I dropped the school and also tried several times to grade after years.
  > Fortunately, good people<sup>1</sup> found me useful and hired me without requiring any of it.
