## How I got into this?

I got into music early on my youth years, I started to learn and play reggae, rock, ska and patchanka covers with Eztli Cuica
and later on with the [ATL Sound System][atl]. There, I learnt how to create music and became the author of original music to play.

A couple of years later I started a new music project with [Carlos Wise (DUB&star;NIX)][nix], learning a new genre which captivated both of us: DUB
&mdash; Unfortunately, I had to move to Jalisco so I paused most of my collaboration to focus entirely on my software engineering career.

Later on 2022 and early 2023 I came with the idea of starting a new project on my own so I played my music with our friends of [Lion Army Sound System][lass]
&mdash; It had a good acceptance through the public on the extint "Plant√≥n 420" upfront the Senate Chamber at Mexico City and ["Pulques La Venta"][plav] near our hometown
(among other venues here at Guadalajara with our friends of [Shaka Dance Sound System][sdss]).

Since then, I have become more confident of my work since then, and now, I've been dedicating more time and money into this new venture!

## What can I do for you?

Shall love to play my music for you, in your venue, between friends!

I have skills and the equipement to provide you the following experiences:

- DJ Set, I can play my music on digital formats; if desired, I can bring CDs or USB sticks, whatever!
- Live Mix, so I can bring my own computer and controller to [perform my music][bw] in a more livid way.
- Digital Mix without a laptop, instead I'll bring a [digital mixer][r16] (8 channels) with a pair of built-in fx to have fun!
- Analog Mix, here I can bring my own [multi-track player][pl16] (16 channels), fx-boxes and wires for more detail and pleasure, this requires lots of focus... but trust me, you won't regret.

In all modes I can bring an instrument (usually a Melodica), and depending of the situation I can use my vocals (ain't much but it's honest work!) to fulfill the space.

I am very new on all of this, but I promise you: I am doing my best and I'll keep trying hard to become better after every session!

## Where you can find my work?

I use [Soundcloud][sc] to primarly upload my music and explore its audience, the same with [Bandcamp][bc], where you can also buy me (or download!) something directly.

From there, my work gets distributed to all major streaming plaforms: [Deezer][de], [Spotify][sp] and [Amazon Music][am] among others.

You can find me through the "ALVADUB" artist name, or just click on the links above.

Regardless of this, you can also download some of my music from here.
