# Hellow there

I would like to spend my spare time on small side-projects, making music or helping colleagues.

**I'm open** to collaborate if I consider it fun or interesting to do. :wink:

Ethics are important to me, lets build good stuff!

### My first love is front-end

- Solid cross-browser knowledge about using HTML5/CSS3
- Responsive design, web components, sprites, svg, etc.
- Scripting with CoffeeScript, ES5/ES6 &amp; beyond!
- Worried about accessibility and usability. &hearts;

### I like to build/break things

- Building websites by using frameworks and mixtures of PHP, Rails, NodeJS and such
- Knowledge on application containers, cache and storage systems, databases, etc.
- Platform implementation using Git and SaaS, PaaS and Unix-based hostings
- Tooling and CI setup, server-side scripting and provisioning

### Overnight developer

- Continuously monitoring industry trends, technologies and stablished standards
- Product design, benchmarking and validation through users feedback
- Server management abilities, remote scripting and configuration
- OpenSource maintainer and [DUB maker](https://dubnix.io)
